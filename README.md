This is the finale project of 42 Web development projects.

It's a project group I did with <a href="https://github.com/Flovln">Flovln </a> and <a href="https://github.com/abanvill">abanvill </a>, two other 42 students.
The purpose of this project is to create a streaming website base on torrent protocol

My part was about React/ Redux as I mainly took care of the Front-End part.
I also learned a lot about Documenting projects during this project.
